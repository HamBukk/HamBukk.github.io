                        <p>I am currently a Senior Computer Science student at West Chester Univserity. I began my journey in Computer Science while I was in Highschool. I had taken a "Intro To Computer Science" course during my Sophmore year and fell in love right then and there. I then decided to Major in Computer Science with a focus on Data Management. My most recent Project was with a start-up named "LeepFrog LLC" where I, and my team, were tasked with creating a CRM for the company that enabled customers to schedule services and pay for them. I am profient in Python, Java and SQL while also learning Javascript and PostgreSQL.</p>
