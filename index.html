                            <p>
                                I am currently a Senior Computer Science student at West Chester University. I began my journey in Computer Science while I was in high school. I had taken an "Intro To Computer Science" course during my sophomore year and fell in love right then and there. I then decided to major in Computer Science with a focus on Data Management. My most recent project was with a start-up named "LeepFrog LLC" where I, and my team, were tasked with creating a CRM for the company that enabled customers to schedule services and pay for them. I am proficient in Python, Java and SQL while also learning JavaScript and PostgreSQL.
